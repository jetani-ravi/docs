## Authentication

All API endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens. You can generate and manage your API keys in your Voice Nova dashboard.

```json
"security": [
  {
    "bearerAuth": []
  }
]
```

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of every request:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <BEARER_TOKEN> 
```
