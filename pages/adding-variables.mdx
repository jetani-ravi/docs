### Injecting Current Time

Voice Nova automatically includes the current date and time in a conversation, aligned with the user’s local timezone.

While Voice Nova attempts to detect the timezone automatically during calls, passing it explicitly ensures greater accuracy.

| Name     | Description                                                                                                   |
| :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| timezone | Name of the timezone based on the [tz database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) |

### Built-in Context Variables

The following system-defined variables are always available in the context of a Voice Nova conversation:

| Variable       | Description                                                                        |
| :------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `agent_id`     | Unique identifier of the AI agent.                                                 |
| `execution_id` | Unique identifier of the specific Voice Nova conversation or call.                 |
| `call_sid`     | Call ID from the telephony provider (e.g., Twilio, Plivo, Vonage).                 |
| `from_number`  | The caller’s number in inbound calls, or your agent’s number in outbound calls.    |
| `to_number`    | The recipient’s number in outbound calls, or your agent’s number in inbound calls. |

These built-in values can be injected directly into prompts or function calls for enhanced clarity or backend use.

### Example: Using Default Variables in Prompts

You can use default variables in your prompt like this:

```
This is your agent Sam. Please have a friendly conversation with the customer.

Please note:
The agent has a unique id which is "{agent_id}".
The call's unique id is "{call_sid}".
The customer's phone number is "{to_number}".
```

At runtime, the system will replace these placeholders with actual values. For example:

```
This is your agent Sam. Please have a friendly conversation with the customer.

Please note:
The agent has a unique id which is "4a8135ce-45fc-4a11-9a33-140fe1ed8cc5".
The call's unique id is "PXNEJUFEWUEWHVEWHQACVE".
The customer's phone number is "+19898989898".
```

### Custom Variables and Dynamic Context

In addition to the default set, you can define your own custom variables. Just wrap the variable name in curly braces `{}` and pass corresponding values at call time.

#### Example Prompt with Custom Variables

```
This is your agent Sam speaking.

May I confirm if your name is {customer_name} and you called us on
{last_contacted_on} to enquire about your order item {product_name}?

Use the call's id which is {call_sid} to automatically transfer the call to a human when the user asks.
```

**Conclusion**\
Contextual variables—both default and custom—enable  Voice Nova AI agents to deliver personalized and accurate voice conversations. By embedding real-time, user-specific information into each interaction, your AI agents become smarter, more responsive, and more human-like.
