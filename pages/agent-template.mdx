## Connect to Knowledge Base or Functions

Enhance your agent with:

- **Knowledge Base:** Let your agent reference documents or FAQs for smarter answers.
- **Function Calls:** Connect to APIs or backend systems to fetch real-time data (e.g., order status, appointment booking).

  > **Use Cases:** Fetch CRM data, update spreadsheets, call Zapier webhooks, etc.
